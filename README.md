Site Reliability Knowledge Base
================================

This repo contains interactive [Schemio](https://schemio.app) diagrams that represent various SRE related topics in as much detail as possible. I decided to start with an answer to an old interview question "What happens when you type a website in your browser address bar and hit enter".

Almost all elements on the diagram are interactive. Some trigger loading of new diagrams, some provide you with additional information.
